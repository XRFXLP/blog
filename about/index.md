Hi,   
Iâ€™m Ajay Mishra, Electrical Engineering undergrad from IIT Kharagpur. I blog about ~~system design, quantum computation, system design~~, philosophy (mostly with cynicism flavour), and other random stuff.

Most of original ideas here are not of mine, my goal here is to get involved in the process of summarizing and think about the consequences of these ideas.
