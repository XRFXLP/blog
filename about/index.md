Hi,   
Iâ€™m Ajay Mishra, an Electrical Engineering undergrad from IIT Kharagpur. I blog about ~~system design, quantum computation, system design~~, philosophy (mainly with a cynicism flavor), and other random stuff.

Most of the original ideas here are not mine. My goal is to get involved in summarizing and thinking about the consequences of these ideas.
