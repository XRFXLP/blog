Hi,   
Iâ€™m Ajay Mishra, an Electrical Engineering undergrad from IIT Kharagpur. I blog about ~~system design, quantum computation, system design~~, philosophy (mainly with a cynicism flavor), and other random stuff.

Most of the original ideas are based off from books or talks or blogs. My goal is to get involved in the process of summarizing and thinking about the consequences of these ideas and get a more coherent, complete and in-depth understanding/insight on the topic.
