Why to write?
<!--more-->

Most of us we only write when we feel the need for communication, after all what follows from prevalent reductionism is that writing is a means of communication, if you do not have to communicate with anyone then what to write for? 
But writing is a quite an evolved form of communication, and in almost all of the communication there are things/relationships at stake which the speaker might unintendendly loose if something is wrong in their writing/speech, so we've "evolved" with ability of closed loop feedback, which basically ensure that whatever we are saying/writing sounds reasonable. 

This naturally evolved form of feedback can be leveraged to clarify the ideas that we have in our heads, which otherwise would stale in irrational background of our mind. Whenever we write we unfold the ideas, which otherwise remained curled showing only single perspective, and by virtue of this process obtained different perspective on the reasoning joints of ideas, this brings a completely objective-like different level of perspective on things. 

In this process of unfolding, we reflect on it piece by piece, check their reasonability and combine these pieces to check their coherency. One cannot reflect in speech in the same way, because the window size available for reflection in the case of speech is very small (10-15 words), so the coherency check is very quite limited. The result of this testing phase of ideas improves the articulation faculty, consequently ideas will be more discrete and organized, which leads to clarity of thoughts, hence increases expressibility of thoughts. Lot of times we feel that words are not able to express the thoughts, but most of the these times, the problem is not in language itself, but more in the faculty of production of language.

There are lot of good side effects on writing as well: it helps in process essentiaziation of ideas. Humans normally use a lot of filling materials in any means of communication to lower down the entry barrier of understanding and let the idea flow freely in coherent manner. But once you understand the bigger picture of the idea, in order to really think of it, you need to lessen the amount of this filling materials as this normally leads unnecessary drag in thoughts. Writing by the virtue of reflection allows one to take out these unnecessary stuffs, and focus on core ideas.
