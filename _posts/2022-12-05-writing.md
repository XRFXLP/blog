Why to write?
<!--more-->

Most of us we only write when there is need for communication, after all what follows from prevalent reductionism is that writing is a means of communication, if you do not have to communicate with anyone then what to write for? 
But writing is a quite an evolved form of communication, and in almost all of the communication there are things/relationships at stake which the speaker might unintendendly loose if something is wrong in their writing/speech, so we've "evolved" with ability of closed loop feedback, which basically ensure that whatever we are saying/writing sounds reasonable. 

This naturally evolved form of feedback can be leveraged to clarify the ideas that we have in our heads, which otherwise would stale in irrational background of our mind. Whenever we write we unfold the ideas, which otherwise remained curled showing only single perspective, and by virtue of this process obtained different perspective on the reasoning joints of ideas, this brings a completely objective-like different level of perspective on things.
