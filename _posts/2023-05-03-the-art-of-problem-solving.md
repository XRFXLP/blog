The book "The Art of Problem-Solving" discuss problem-solving in a system-thinking paradigm which authors argue to be inadequate in real-world problem-solving. System thinking involves studying the interrelationship and interaction between components and how the system fits in the world.

A puzzle is a problem one cannot solve because of a self-imposed constraint. Self-imposed constraints shackle creativity. Therefore, the key to freeing it lies in developing an ability to identify and deliberately remove such constraints. 

Ackoff discusses a general framework for any problem: 
+ decision maker(s)
+ variables that the decision makers can control: controllable variables 
+ variables that decision maker(s) cannot control, but these affect the outcome of the problem: uncontrolled variables
+ constraints on controllable and uncontrolled variables
+ possible outcome combining everything

For the decision maker, the problem consists of the following:
+ Objective: desired outcome
+ Controlled variables: course of action
+ Uncontrolled variables: environment
+ Relationship between these things
 
## Objective
Problems involve negatively and positively oriented objectives. In negative-oriented objectives, we try to remove the source of dissatisfaction, while in positive-oriented objectives, we try to add the source of satisfaction. 

Another classification of objectives is based on "means" and "ends." But these are relative terms: every less-than-ultimate end can be considered a means or more ultimate end, and every means can be regarded as an end of the satisfaction of the satisfactory as every means has some intrinsic, non-instrumental value.

One can enjoy the game others play but only have fun if played by oneself. 

The end of a problem may be the beginning of another problem.

The effort to eliminate what we do not want is reactive, retrospective, oriented problem-solving. The effort to obtain what we want is proactive, prospectively oriented problem-solving. In the former,  we move away from something; in the latter, we try to approach some specified ideals. Due to the focus on deficiency independently rather than the relationship between things in retrospectively oriented problem-solving, the chances of overlooking relevant consequences are minimized when we formulate a problem in terms of approaching one or more ideals.

Proactive planning consists of a desirable future and finding ways of moving toward it as effectively as possible. The design of a desirable future is best carried out when it is embedded in the idealized design: a description of what designers would have now if they were only subject to two constraints: technological feasibility and operational viability.
