_What are mental models and thinking tools?_
<!--more-->

If one imagines thoughts/stream of reasoning as flow, then thinking tools are some mechanicsm by which one can control or manipulate the flow of thoughts. But normally flows are too simple to capture even the prominently reasonable aspects of thoughts. Some of the thinking tools are: labels, examples, cartesian coordinates (basically all of science and math)

Mental models, somewhat similar to thinking tools, are some rough representation of a system in real world by means of analogy. They are the methods of structuring particular aspect of belief and their mechanism over an already known system. The idea for mental models is to keep the numbers of these in the sweet spot: you don't want to increase these numbers prematurely, as the system of reasoning may not be developed for all of them, niether you want to have very few mental models by making the model very general. Problem is this loss of generality might s lose the specific specificness of the system under consideration, which might be quite integral part of the same.
