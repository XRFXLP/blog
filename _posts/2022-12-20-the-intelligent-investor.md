"The Intelligent Investor" is a book about value investing. Value investing is an investment strategy that seeks to buy stocks trading for less than their intrinsic value.

The book classifies two classes of intelligent investors: "defensive" investors (who are seeking to protect their capital but generate only modest returns) and "enterprising" investors (who are willing to take more risk in exchange for higher returns).
