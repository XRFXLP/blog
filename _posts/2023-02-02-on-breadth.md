    _Things to care about_
---
<!--more-->

All of the advice, knowledge, and lessons assume that the reader has the will to live and to care about their state of living. Or, less generally, advice about aspect $$ X $$ of life depends (obviously) on whether one cares about it.  One usually chooses the aspects of life one wants to care about. This set $$ S $$ of aspects (with elements having aspects $$ X $$) is not dynamic; they are static, and they are what gives rise to an emergent property:  “personality.”

But the problem is this choice is not “optimal” (here, the measure of optimality is not precise because the reference is what is talked about, and it is not a trivial parameter for measuring reference for reference) because the set of aspects S that we care about generally tends to be very small because:

`1.` One aspect $$ X_1 $$ might contradict the other $$X_2$$, like caring about individuality and being part of the group. One, out of context, is not better than the other, but making a balance between them is pretty challenging. And sometimes when we see two different aspects as a substitute to each other, might turn out to be a really good complement of each other.

`2.` Some carings are self-reinforcing, and coupled with our limited focus and single-threaded ness of the conscious mind; we slip down the slippery slope and care about just a few mutually-agreeing aspects.

`3.` Sometimes what we care about cling with our identity and even if other aspects not contradict with the one we are caring of, it is challenging to opts others.

To solve this problem while caring about one aspect (if done consciously), one can think about the opposite-ish aspect and consider it, so one always stays at the boundary of caring rather than slipping down to a singular one.
