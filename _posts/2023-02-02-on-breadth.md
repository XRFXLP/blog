_Things to care about_
<!--more-->

All of the advice, knowledge, and lessons assume that the reader has the will to live and to care about their state of living. Or, less generally, advice about aspect X of life depends (obviously) on whether one cares about it.  One usually chooses the aspects of life one wants to care about. This set S of aspects (with elements having aspects X) is not dynamic; they are static, and they are what gives rise to an emergent property:  “personality.”

But the problem is this choice is not “optimal” (here, the measure of optimality is not precise because the reference is what is talked about, and it is not a trivial parameter for measuring reference for reference) because the set of aspects S that we care about generally tends to be very small because:

`1.` One aspect $$ X_1 $$ might contradict the other $$X_2$$, like caring about individuality and being part of the group. One, out of context, is not better than the other, but making a balance between them is pretty challenging.  

`2.` Some carings are self-reinforcing, and coupled with our limited focus and single-threaded ness of the conscious mind; we slip down the “lust” and care about just a few mutually-agreeing aspects.

To solve this problem while caring about one aspect (if done consciously), one can think about the opposite-ish aspect and consider it, so one always stays at the boundary of caring rather than slipping down to a singular one.
