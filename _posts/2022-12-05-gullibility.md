  _Why people are so gullible?_

_This post is mostly inspired the book: [Not Born Yesterday](https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691178707/not-born-yesterday) by Hugo Mercier_

We are quite gullible, and the trivial explanation is: 
> We almost always rely on learning from others, and since there is natural tendency to oversimplify things and reduce the mental loads, we resort to heuristics for verifying this recieved information. These heuristics can be like "follow the majority" or "follow the authority".

Ironically, this is the simpler and wrong-ish explanation with boolean (is heuristics been used?) assumption.
